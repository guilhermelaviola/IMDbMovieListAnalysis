# MovieRatingAnalysis

In this repository, I provided studies for several different topics involving movies and actors:
1. **Watchlist study:** It's a study to explore the possibilities with my Watchlist from IMDb.
2. **My Ratings study:** It's a study to explore the possibilities with my My Ratings list from IMDb.
3. **Favorite Actors study:** In this study, I use a spreadsheet with my favorite actors names and birth dates.
4. **IMDBP√ù:** It's a file in which I practice the usage of the IMDBPY library with Python
